## Why This Portfolio?

> Designed not just to **showcase**, but to **interact**.

Recruiters and collaborators can:
- Chat directly with the AI for project links or personal info
- Contact me instantly via the form
- Access live demos and GitHub repos directly from the chat

---

## Bonus: AI with Personality

Each chatbot is crafted with its own tone and purpose — one is a professional guide to my work, the other is a personal assistant that reflects who I am.
